# Recommender
Graph-Based Recommender System 

It's a recommender system developed in python which is working based on collaborative filtering. We create the graph based on similiarity between users (according to the similiar ranks). In next level we extract the user graph features which are combining by some user data. We use these features to clustering users and then suggest new items to different users based on the average ranks of their clusters.
